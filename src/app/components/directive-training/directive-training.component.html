<div ngNonBindable [appHighlight]="'red'" textColor='white'>Text to be highlited when mouse is over it</div>
<!-- we can bind static values by removing the square brackets, as we did with "textColor" input -->
<!-- IMPORTANT: ngNonBindable does not affect attribute and its inputs, as shows the example above -->
